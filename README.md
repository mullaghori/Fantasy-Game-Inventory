# List to Dictionary Function for Fantasy Game Inventory

It's a practice project for python beginners. 

*👉 Imagine that a vanquished dragon’s loot is represented as a list of strings like  this: 
```dragonLoot = ['gold coin', 'dagger', 'gold coin', 'gold coin', 'ruby']```*

***Write a function named  addToInventory(inventory, addedItems), where the inventory  parameter is a dictionary representing the player’s inventory (like in the previous project) and the  addedItems  parameter is a list like  dragonLoot.***

*👉 The  `addToInventory()`  function should return a dictionary that represents the updated inventory. Note that the  `addedItems`  list can contain multiples of the same item.*

*👉 Your code could look something like this: 
```
def addToInventory(inventory, addedItems):
       # your code goes here
inv = {'gold coin': 42, 'rope': 1}
dragonLoot = ['gold coin', 'dagger', 'gold coin', 'gold coin', 'ruby'] 
inv = addToInventory(inv, dragonLoot)
displayInventory(inv) 
```
       
The previous program (with your  displayInventory()  function from the previous project) would output the following: Inventory: 45 gold coin 1 rope 1 ruby 1 dagger Total number of items: 48
